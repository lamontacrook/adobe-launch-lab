# Adobe Launch Lab

Setting Up the Environment

In order to work with Launch and learn the basics of Tag Management and creating a data layer we first need a site to work with.  We will be using a couple sample websites that can be cloned in this repository.

You will also need a webserver to run the websites on.  For Launch to work you need a properly formed URL.  If you don't have a local webserver running on your machine I would recommend this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb).  This will allow you to browse to these local websites using your browser.  You can certainly use whatever webserver you would like as long as you can edit and change the HTML of the files.
